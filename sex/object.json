Nevertheless, the long period of the dissipation indicates a powerful impact of male height on women's psychology, probably prepared by evolution.",

    "quote1": "We examined how two indices of women’s attractiveness, body mass index (BMI) and waist–hip ratio (WHR), relate to perceptions of both the attractiveness and trustworthiness of masculinized versus feminized male faces. Consistent with previous studies, women with a low (attractive) WHR had stronger preferences for masculine male faces than did women with a relatively high (unattractive) WHR. This relationship remained significant when controlling for possible effects of BMI",

For example, masculinity ratings of men’s faces are positively associated with health as assessed from medical records (Rhodes, Chan, Zebrowitz, & Simmons, 2003) and masculine facial proportions are negatively associated with the incidence and duration of men’s respiratory illnesses (Thornhill & Gangestad, 2006).",
